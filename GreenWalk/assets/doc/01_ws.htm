	<h1>The National Centre for Sustainability and Environmental Design (WS)</h1>
	<p>
		Our buildings can have a large impact on our environment from the materials used in construction to the energy
		and water they use in daily operation. New buildings have to meet a number of energy and water efficiency
		standards. This sustainability building features:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Passive solar design that shades the building from hot summer sun and lets winter sun in to warm the building.</li>
		<li>A high percentage of recycled and low energy intensive materials used in construction.</li>
		<li>Natural sunlight usage is complimented by an energy efficient lighting system.</li>
		<li>Energy efficient heating and cooling systems utilising thermal chimneys and natural ventilation.</li>
		<li>Large earth banks to increase the buildings thermal mass helping to keep the building at a constant temperature.</li>
		<li>Grid connected photovoltaic panels generating electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. (Rated at 3kW)</li>
		<li>A 90,000 litre rainwater tank reduces storm water runoff and supplies water for toilets and gardens.</li>
		<li>Bicycle racks, showers and change rooms to encourage sustainable transport and exercise.</li>
		<li>Our Smart Automation Training Laboratory where students learn to use the latest technology to model efficient manufacturing processes.</li>
	</ul>
