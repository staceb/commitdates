	<h1>Living Green Wall and Solar Pergola</h1>
	<p>
		On city buildings, living walls create an attractive feature that helps regulate internal building temperature by
		acting as an external insulation layer around the building. In cities these walls also help to reduce the &lsquo;heat bank effect&rsquo;
		(cities heat up a lot because of all the buildings and roads).
	</p>

	<p>
		Providing power to the pumps and systems of the living wall is a 1.5kW photovoltaic (solar) array. The array is
		integrated into the building framework to form a Solar Pergola that provides shading for the North facing
		windows on hot summer days.

		<li>Rainwater harvested from roof and stored in water tanks.</li>
		<li>Rainwater is pumped up to the top of the green living wall.</li>
		<li>The plants absorb the water.</li>
		<li>Any runoff water is used in the adjacent garden beds.</li>
