	<h1>Rain garden, drainage swale &amp; Renewable Energy Solar Training Area</h1>
	<p>
		This demonstration rain garden and drainage swale captures rainwater runoff. Their functions are to
		slow the rate of rainwater going into the storm water system, which reduces flooding and erosion in
		our rivers and streams. The combination of the sand filter and microbes associated with plant roots
		clean the water by &lsquo;eating up&rsquo; pollutants which helps keep our rivers and streams healthy.
		This system mimics the natural designs and functions of creeks and wetlands.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Renewable Energy Solar Training Area located up the hill next to the wind turbine allows students
		to design stand alone power supply systems and safely simulate solar panel installations. You too can
		learn about photovoltaic (solar) panel installation or grid connected systems by enquiring at Swinburne
		about one of our renewable energy courses.
