	<h1>Solar Hot Water &amp; Solar Panel Training Units</h1>
	<p>
		The solar hot water unit uses the suns energy to produce enough hot water for a large Victorian household
		(approximately 300 litres per day). This unit uses evacuated tube technology which gives it a greater surface
		area to collect sunlight when compared to a regular flat plate solar collector. In cooler weather, a heat pump
		or small gas booster unit may be needed to help reach the required temperature so you can enjoy a wonderfully
		hot four minute shower. Students can monitor the performance and efficiency of the unit as part of their
		renewable energy courses.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Three strings of photovoltaic panels facing East, North and West provides a working case study for students
		to learn about the effects of shading and orientation on panel performance. For real time remote observation
		there are internet connected cameras mounted on the building parapet.
	</p>

	<p>
		Inside the building, the Smart Lighting and Energy Management laboratory allows students to learn about the
		latest integrated lighting and energy management technologies. Smart lighting systems can reduce energy consumption
		and lower building operating costs.
