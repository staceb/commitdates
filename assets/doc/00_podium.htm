	<h1>Grand Green Walk</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to Swinburne University&rsquo;s Renewable Energy and Smart Technology precinct at our Wantirna campus.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Sustainability is a journey where human behaviour and new innovative technologies are combined with our
		growing knowledge of natural systems to create a world that &ldquo;meets the needs of the present without
		compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&rdquo;.1
	</p>

	<p>
		We invite you to enjoy a self guided tour of our campus where you will see and learn more about the renewable
		energy, smart technology and sustainability features we have onsite.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The tour is best enjoyed during our opening hours of Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm.
