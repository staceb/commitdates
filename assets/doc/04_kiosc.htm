	<h1>Knox Innovation, Opportunity and Sustainability Centre (KIOSC)</h1>
	<p>
		KIOSC involves a partnership between seven secondary collages and Swinburne. The facility will be used to conduct
		training and skill development in science, manufacturing, engineering, electrotechnology and renewable energy
		solutions. Five practical training laboratories are complimented by an interactive Discovery Centre.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The building features environmentally sustainable design and intelligent building concepts to minimise energy and water usage:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Skylights and window placement provide optimum levels of natural light.</li>
		<li>Service core at the Western end of the building provides a thermal buffer to afternoon solar loads.</li>
		<li>Utilises high levels of natural ventilation to cool the building. Passive solar design &amp; solar shading. Energy saving building management systems.</li>
		<li>The building itself is also considered as a teaching tool, whereby innovation in design will engage and inform the students as part of their overall experience.</li>
	</ul>
