	<h1>Wind Turbine &amp; Pole Mounted Solar Panels</h1>
	<p>
		Every day our planet receives more than enough energy through the wind and the sun to power our society.
		Our challenge is to harness that energy and use it wisely.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Wind turbines generate electricity without producing any greenhouse gas. The wind propels these 3.7m long
		blades which turn a generator that produces Direct Current (DC) electricity. An invertor converts this
		electricity to Alternating Current (AC) power which is then fed into the electricity grid.
	</p>
	
	<p style="font-style: italic;">
		This Skystream 2.4kW wind turbine is designed for the residential household market and can produce about
		400kWh of electricity per month in a 20km/h wind. This is enough electricity to power a small energy efficient home.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In our homes, photovoltaic panels are normally mounted on the roof. This site demonstrates a pole mounted
		1.2kW solar panel array connected to the grid. On the roof of the building to the South there is another
		3.6kW grid connected solar panel array producing more renewable energy. Mounted next to the array is an
		anemometer providing data about the prevailing wind. For remote observation there are weatherproof
		internet connected cameras mounted on the building parapet.
