	<h1>Sustainable Campus Gardens</h1>
	<p>
		Being the centre for Swinburneâ€™s horticulture training, our campus grounds are very important. Not only is
		the campus a showcase for a huge variety of plants but also shows how our gardens can contribute positively
		to the wider environment.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The campus grounds are maintained in an environmentally sensitive way by:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Using rainwater tanks to reduce use of potable water.</li>
		<li>Avoiding the use of herbicides, pesticides and other chemicals.</li>
		<li>Recycling our green waste into compost and mulch.</li>
		<li>Many local native plants create food and habitat for native fauna.</li>
		<li>Avoiding plants that are environmental weeds.</li>
	</ul>
